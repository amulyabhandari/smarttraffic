                SmartCard for Driving Licence which was recently issued in Nepal.</br>

                As we are aware about the chaotic method of the issue of chit, we have agreed in making a small
                prototype in which a database is created which saves the information of the licence holder and shows
                their history of pending chit, along with the number of traffic rule violations. Also, the
                information of the traffic class for the particular driver's notification is sent to their
                respective notification centre.
